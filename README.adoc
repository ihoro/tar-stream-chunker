= tar-stream-chunker

Splits stdin onto chunk files and writes resulting TAR archive to stdout.
Initial motivation was to use it for backup streaming to tarsnap.com.

Usage example:
`$ pg_dump | tar-stream-chunker --file-name dump.sql --chunk-size 500000000 | tarsnap -cvf dump.daily.$(date +%Y%m%d.%H%M%S)`
